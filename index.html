          <strong>11 March 1802 — </strong>Dessalines and his 1,300 men
          defended a small fort against 18,000 attackers. To motivate his
          troops at the start of the battle, he waved a lit torch near an open
          powder keg and declared that he would blow the fort up should the
          French break through.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>October 1802 — </strong>When it became clear that the French

          independent nation.
